# CRM Project

This is a simple CRM application built with Rails, Active Admin, and Active Storage.

## Getting Started

### Admin Interface
Access the admin dashboard to manage customer records:
- [Admin Page](http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin)

### Customer Listing
View the list of customers on the front end:
- [Customer Index](http://localhost:3000/)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `rails db:migrate` to set up the database.
4. Start the Rails server with `rails server`.
5. Access the admin dashboard and customer index using the links above.

## Additional Information

- Active Admin is used for managing customers (CRUD operations, image uploads, etc.).
- The customer index page displays all customers using a reusable partial.

Happy coding!
